# BeerJS: Tampa Bay

BeerJS Tampa Bay is a welcoming get-together for everyone who wants to learn about JavaScript. We meet the last week of the month. That's all the planning we have: whoever shows up decides what happens.

Come and hang out with engineers, developers, hobbyist, and people just interested in what we do.  Maybe you will make a friend or two.
